                            Participation in a loyalty program with incentives ensures
                            complete engagement, fostering a stronger connection between
                            the store and the industry. The primary advantage for the store owner is the assurance that the industry will consistently offer a suitable portfolio at the right price, both for sell-in and sell-out, based on the store's location. Additionally, by using this application and providing up-to-date and accurate information, the store stands to gain discounts or rebates from the CPG industry.
