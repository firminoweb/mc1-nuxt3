section2_title: Mobile App Showcase

section2_col1_title: User Persona 1

section2_col1_subtitle: Store Execution Auditor or Promoter

section2_col1_text: This persona plays a pivotal role in capturing photographs of designated spaces for market analysis. The objective is to obtain real-time key performance indicators and insights about the store's execution. Through the mobile app, the auditor or promoter can quickly and efficiently capture, analyze, and report on the store's product placement, promotional displays, and overall visual merchandising.

section2_col2_title: User Persona 2

section2_col2_subtitle: Mom & Pop's Operator

section2_col2_text: The Mom & Pop's Operator seeks an app experience that is straightforward and hassle-free. They desire an app that requires minimal interactions — just a few clicks. Rather than being overwhelmed with a plethora of information, this user primarily values direct feedback on their performance.

section2_col2_text2: Key feedback includes; Points earned for successfully capturing a photo. Points for arranging the suggested product portfolio as recommended. Points for ensuring sell-out prices align with the suggested rates. Points for adhering to product restocking suggestions based on items not identified in the captured image. This streamlined feedback system empowers the Mom & Pop's Operator to make quick decisions and adjustments, ensuring they remain aligned with industry recommendations.

section3_title: The Full Process Behind the Technology

section3_slide1_title: Machine Learning and Edge Computing

section3_slide1_text: We've reduced the "cost to serve" by eliminating cloud processing for product identification in images. Instead, this processing happens directly on smartphones. The limitation on the number of objects and products recognized solely depends on the smartphone's capabilities.

section3_slide2_title: Data Analysis

section3_slide2_text: Instead of transmitting every captured image to the cloud, smartphones send only the processing results. This not only delivers enhanced performance to the process but also significantly reduces the lead-time for near-real-time decision-making.

section3_slide3_title: Actionable Insights

section3_slide3_text: Users receive real-time information and guidance directly on their smartphones, without the need for an internet connection. For back-office users, our "chatCPG" offers interaction with Natural Language Processing (NLP) to fetch desired insights.

section3_slide4_title: Effortless Integration

section3_slide4_text: Don't limit yourself to using IRE in isolation! Seamlessly integrate our solution with other systems — from deep-linking with other Android and iOS apps to our extensive API for data exchange and analytics.

section4_col1_title: Use Cases

section4_col1_text: Our product features a loyalty program functionality, awarding points to users in a gamified manner based on their interactions and compliance results. These points can be redeemed for various benefits, determined by each industry's strategy. Simultaneously, as loyalty data is generated, we relay real-time market data to the industry, either directly or via third-party applications integrated with our platform, right from the point of data collection.

section4_col2_title: The Benefits

section4_col2_text: Participation in a loyalty program with incentives ensures complete engagement, fostering a stronger connection between the store and the industry. The primary advantage for the store owner is the assurance that the industry will consistently offer a suitable portfolio at the right price, both for sell-in and sell-out, based on the store's location. Additionally, by using this application and providing up-to-date and accurate information, the store stands to gain discounts or rebates from the CPG industry.

section5_title: IRE Key Differentials

section5_col1_title: Unlimited Categories

section5_col1_text: No restriction on the number of product categories to be planned in planograms for identification from one or multiple photos.

section5_col2_title: 100% Offline

section5_col2_text: Designed for maximum performance, ensuring the quickest response time to users requiring no-internet connection.

section5_col3_title: On-device Machine Learning

section5_col3_text: The machine learning process runs directly on the smartphone. This reduces operational costs and allows for wider retail use, not just limited to large chains or sampling, as seen with other solutions.

section5_col4_title: Native Integration

section5_col4_text: Seamlessly integrated with the one-stop-shop MC1 platform, continuously feeding our AI with assortment suggestions and price recommendations for both sell-in and sell-out.

section5_col5_title: Ease of Integration with Other Apps and Systems

section5_col5_text: Through deep-linking and REST API, our solution can be integrated at the smartphone level for local operations. For cloud-based operations, our REST API facilitates data exchange both in-bound and out-bound.
